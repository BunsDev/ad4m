# Introduction

The internet has evolved from creating and sharing simple documents and websites to highly social digital experiences.
Yet, there is still no social infrastructure baked into the fabric of the web.

ADAM tries to provide a minimal assumption of what is needed to create any type of social app,
and make these apps interoperable with each other.

It tries to capture the essence of what _really_ goes on in human communication networks,
instead of having the technology dictate how we communicate.

ADAM takes the assumption that any social network consists of:

- **Agents**
- **Languages**
- **Perspectives**

As a digital _social_ layer on top of the web,
ADAM starts with the most important thing in a social network â€“ The **Agents** in the network.

In the same way computers have their own unique IP address on the internet,
each agent in ADAM has their own DID (decentralized identifier).

An agent can

**Languages** include **Expressions** in their definition, and **Perspectives** include **Links** (Link Expressions, to be precise).

Through combination of these basic principles, two important derived concepts
are constructed:

- **Neighbourhoods** (i.e. shared Perspectives)
- **Social Organisms** (i.e. fractal, super agents, defined through shared perspectives and shared interaction patterns/social DNA).

All these are discussed in detail in the [Concepts section](/concepts).

## Spanning Layer

Similar to how the IP layer decouples application protocols from physical links
and allows many-to-many combinations between them by capturing the quintessence
of computer networks through the assignment of a unique address to each and
every node,
AD4M integrates DID to assume a unique and independent/sovereign address per human/agent
and decouple application specific semantics from data storage and integrity layers.

![spanning layer](/images/ad4m-spanning-layer.png)

AD4M is an interoperability layer that sits between an app's UI and the
(centralized or decentralized) back-end components or p2p networks.
Using AD4M, an app can be built without being coupled to a specific storage
technology.
Both app developers and users are able to switch Languages and with them storage
layers while keeping the other components of their running app.

The sections [Getting started](/getting-started) and [Writing and using Social DNA](/social-dna)
cover the uper parts of the stack,
[Creating AD4M Languages](/languages) shows how to wrap existing storage layers
and create new ones as Languages.

## Why?

The goal is to arrive at scalable and interoparable communication infrastructure
that enables **group agency**, i.e. **super agents** (here called Social Organisms)
**without imposing a bias on how a group manages itself**
(and how it defines its coherence) to have agency
and which technological details or semantic slaings they have chosen.

_This is the real problem we're facing when trying to provide a
technological solution to the web's fractured sense-making._

AD4M is a sense-making network disguised as app development framework.
AD4M apps don't have to leak any of the AD4M concepts at all,
and they would still be interoperable with each other to the degree
of just being different views/portals into the same agent-centric semantic web.

AD4M brings Game B qualities to web3.

It's **web B**.
