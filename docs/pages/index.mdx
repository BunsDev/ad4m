# Introduction

The internet has evolved from creating and sharing simple documents to highly social digital experiences.
Yet, there is still no social infrastructure baked into the fabric of the web.

The lack of a social protocol has resulted in companies taking the role of building out these social networks
in silos, harvesting and profiting on the content created within these social spaces.

ADAM tries to solve this problem, by putting agents and their social context
at the core of our digital communication.

    A person has several user accounts on several social media networks,
    creating silos between data, and ownership at the app level.

    An agent participate in several social groups, and apps ask for permission
    to access these groups – giving ownership to agents and their social groups.

## What is ADAM?

ADAM is both a **spanning layer** that connects different technologies, as well as an
**application development framework**, empowering developers to build a wide range of
applications with greater flexibility and interoperability.

It tries to capture the essence of what _really_ goes on in human communication networks,
instead of having the technology dictate how we communicate.

Using ADAM, apps can be built without being coupled to a specific storage
technology. Both app developers and users are able to switch storage
layers while keeping the other components of their app.

ADAM provides the foundation for seamless
integration between diverse apps and networks, paving the way for a
more unified and coherent digital landscape.

By implementing the ADAM layer, we can move towards a more interconnected,
human-centric digital ecosystem that supports meaningful communication and
collaboration – ultimately unlocking the full potential of our digital experiences,
**without locking users into one specific platform, network, technology, or app.**

## Why should I build on ADAM?

ADAM solves a lot of common challenges when developing applications. Here are some of them:

- **Cold Start**: When a new social platform has limited content and a small user base, it is challenging to attract users and engagement. Using ADAM you can avoid this by interfacing with already existing agents and their social groups.
- **Authentication**: Authentication is already taken care of, reducing the overload of having to implement authentication flows and user management.
- **Database management**: ADAM is completely decentralized, hence there is no database to manage, and no infrastructure you need to scale.
- **Interoperability**: You are not locked into using one kind of storage technology, and you can switch out your tech stack incrementally.

## How does it work?

ADAM defines a minimal set of assumptions of what is needed to create any type of social application.

| Definition                             | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Agents](/concepts#agents)             | The agents in the network.                                         |
| [Languages](/concepts#languages)       | The different ways agents can express ideas.                       |
| [Perspectives](/concepts#perspectives) | The collection of these expressions organized in a meaningful way. |

Through a combination of these basic principles, two important concepts are constructed:

| Definition                              | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Neighbourhoods](/concepts#agents)      | Shared Perspectives.                            |
| [Social Organisms](/concepts#languages) | A Neighbourhood acting like a collective Agent. |

Here is a visualization of how these concepts interact with each other:

All these are discussed in detail in the [Concepts section](/concepts).

## How does this differ from Nostr / Bluesky / Mastadon / etc?

There are many similarities between ADAM and Nostr, Bluesky, and other social protocols.
Here are some key features of ADAM that sets it apart from them:

### Agent-Centric

Nostr, Mastadon and Bluesky all are federated systems. In these
federated systems, the focus is primarily on the server or instance hosting the user's data.
In contrast, ADAM places the emphasis on the user or the "Agent" themselves.

In an Agent-Centric system like ADAM, each individual user is considered an autonomous
agent with control over their data and interactions. The system revolves around
empowering users to have greater ownership and agency over their online presence.

### Capability tokens

ADAM implements a capability token system. Every app needs to be granted access
to an Agents data, by obtaining a temporary token. At any
time the agent can revoke these tokens in their ADAM instance.

On the other hand, each Nostr app needs to keep the secret key locally. This makes the attack vectors
greater. If an attacker steals the secret key, all the users data could be leaked.

### Interoperability

Languages in ADAM is a powerful concept that makes any Expression an Agent creates resolvable by
another Agent through the URL of that Expression. Having a generic way of resolving data independent of the underlying
protocol makes ADAM interoparable with any kind of centralized, or decentralized system.

### Validation rules

## Why?

The goal is to arrive at scalable and interoparable communication infrastructure
that enables **group agency**, i.e. **super agents** (here called Social Organisms)
**without imposing a bias on how a group manages itself**
(and how it defines its coherence) to have agency
and which technological details or semantic slaings they have chosen.

_This is the real problem we're facing when trying to provide a
technological solution to the web's fractured sense-making._

AD4M is a sense-making network disguised as app development framework.
AD4M apps don't have to leak any of the AD4M concepts at all,
and they would still be interoperable with each other to the degree
of just being different views/portals into the same agent-centric semantic web.

AD4M brings Game B qualities to web3.

It's **web B**.
