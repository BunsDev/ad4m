# Introduction

The internet has evolved from creating and sharing simple documents to highly social digital experiences.
Yet, there is still no social infrastructure baked into the fabric of the web.

The lack of a social protocol has resulted in companies taking the role of building out these social networks
in silos, harvesting and profiting on the content created within these social spaces.

ADAM tries to provide this infrastructure, by putting agents and their social context
at the core of our digital communication.

      A person has several user accounts on several social media networks,

      An agent participate in several social groups, and apps ask for permission
      to access these groups – giving ownership to agents and their social
      groups.

## What is ADAM?

ADAM is both a **spanning layer** that connects different technologies, as well as an
**application development framework**, empowering developers to build a wide range of
applications with greater flexibility and interoperability.

It tries to capture the essence of what _really_ goes on in human communication networks,
instead of having the technology dictate how we communicate.

Using ADAM, apps can be built without being coupled to a specific storage
technology. Both app developers and users are able to switch storage
layers while keeping the other components of their app.

ADAM provides the foundation for seamless
integration between diverse apps and networks, paving the way for a
more unified and coherent digital landscape.

By implementing the ADAM layer, we can move towards a more interconnected,
human-centric digital ecosystem that supports meaningful communication and
collaboration – ultimately unlocking the full potential of our digital experiences,
**without locking users into one specific platform, network, technology, or app.**

## How does it work?

ADAM defines a minimal set of assumptions of what is needed to create any type of social application.

| Definition                             | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Agents](/concepts#agents)             | The agents in the network.                                         |
| [Languages](/concepts#languages)       | The different ways people express ideas.                           |
| [Perspectives](/concepts#perspectives) | The collection of these expressions organized in a meaningful way. |

Through a combination of these basic principles, two important concepts are constructed:

| Definition                              | Description                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [Neighbourhoods](/concepts#agents)      | Shared Perspectives.                            |
| [Social Organisms](/concepts#languages) | A Neighbourhood acting like a collective Agent. |

All these are discussed in detail in the [Concepts section](/concepts).

## How does this differ from Nostr / Bluesky / etc?

There are many similarities between ADAM and Norsr, Bluesky, Mastadon etc.
The key difference is that these usually use a federated system. In Nostr every client has to keep the secret key stored.
This creates a lot of attack vectors. ADAM implements a capability system to ensure you can revoke an apps access to your data at any point,
and also fine tune what kind of data the client will have access to.

More information is coming.

## Why?

The goal is to arrive at scalable and interoparable communication infrastructure
that enables **group agency**, i.e. **super agents** (here called Social Organisms)
**without imposing a bias on how a group manages itself**
(and how it defines its coherence) to have agency
and which technological details or semantic slaings they have chosen.

_This is the real problem we're facing when trying to provide a
technological solution to the web's fractured sense-making._

AD4M is a sense-making network disguised as app development framework.
AD4M apps don't have to leak any of the AD4M concepts at all,
and they would still be interoperable with each other to the degree
of just being different views/portals into the same agent-centric semantic web.

AD4M brings Game B qualities to web3.

It's **web B**.
