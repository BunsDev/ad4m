# Expressions

In any social network, people need to be able to communicate.
In ADAM, Agents communicate by creating [Expressions](concepts/#expressions) using
[Languages](concepts/#languages).

We will go into depth on how to use other languages or how to create your own, but for now let's
use the simplest language that is included in ADAM â€“ the `Literal` language. The `Literal` Language is an AD4M Language without back-end.
It stores JavaScript literals (i.e. strings, numbers and objects) by encoding them into the Expression URLs.

```ts
const url = await ad4m.expression.create("Hello World!", "literal");
```

When running `create` the data will be created using the language, and automatically signed
by your agent.

The result when creating an expression will be a URL formatted like this `<language>://<expression>`.
This is how you can retrieve an expression and it's data:

```ts
const expression = await ad4m.expression.get(expressionUrl);
```

The result will look something like this:

```js
{
    author: "did:key:zQ3shv5VUAbtY5P1jGsPzy7L27FTxeDv2hnhVp9QT3ALNCnQ2",
    timestamp: "2023-06-21T14:47:48.935Z",
    data: "Hello World!",
    language: {
        "address": "literal"
    },
    proof: {
        "valid": true,
        "invalid": false
    }
}
```

For now we have only created something we could call **objective** data. What we mean with this is that
any agent with the URL of the Expression will be able to resolve it.

In the next chapter we will learn how to organize these expression in something
called [Perspectives](/concepts/#perspectives). These are essentially local graph databases that in
turn can be turned into [Neighbourhoods](/concepts#neighbourhoods) (Shared social spaces).
