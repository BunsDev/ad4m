## Languages

Languages are essentially Javascript modules that encapsulate how to retrieve and create content.
The modules can implement different protocols like IPFS, Holochain, AWS, Torrents, or any other technology.

For creating an expression we need to select a language that we create an expression in:

```js
const languages = await ad4mClient.languages.all();
const noteIpfsAddress = languages.find((l) => l.name === "note-ipfs").address;
```

### Creating an Expression

```js
const exprAddress = await ad4mClient.expression.create(
  "A new text note",
  noteIpfsAddress
);
```
