# Concepts

## Agents

ADAM starts with the most important thing in a social network
– The **Agents** in the network.

In the same way computers have their own unique IP address on the internet,
each agent in ADAM has their own [Decentralized Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier). Users can either use their
existing identity or create a new one.

When you create a DID, you generate a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key.
The private key is like a secret code that only you know and should keep safe.
It's used to prove that you are the rightful owner of the DID. On the other hand,
the public key is shared with others and allows them to verify your identity.

## Languages

Languages are essentially Javascript modules that encapsulate how to retrieve and create content.
The modules can implement different protocols like IPFS, Holochain, AWS, Torrents, or any other technology.

[Language interface](/jsdoc/interfaces/Language)

## Expressions

Agents can create Expressions using [Languages](#languages):

```js
const url = await ad4m.expression.create(content, language);
```

The resulting URL are identified like this: `<language>://<expression>`.

Expressions will be signed by the Agent creating it, to ensure authenticity, and any Agent can retrieve
the expression and get the data and validate the signature:

```js
const expression = await ad4m.expression.get(url);
```

The content of the `expression` result will look something like this:

```js
{
    author: "did:key:zQ3shv5VUAbtY5P1jGsPzy7L27FTxeDv2hnhVp9QT3ALNCnQ2",
    timestamp: "2023-06-21T14:47:48.935Z",
    data: "Hello World!",
    language: {
        "address": "literal"
    },
    proof: {
        "valid": true,
        "invalid": false
    }
}
```

## Perspectives

In AD4M, “Perspectives” are private graph databases that represent context and association
between Expression’s. Perspectives only consist of a collection of “links,” which connect
three things: a subject, a predicate, and a target. All three things are URLs pointing to
Expression data in different Languages. Links inside Perspectives have a signature and show
which agent the link came from. Expressions show the same data to everyone who looks at them,
but Perspectives show how one user connects different Expressions in their own way.
