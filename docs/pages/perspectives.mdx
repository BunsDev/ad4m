# Perspectives

Perspectives are one of the foundational concepts in ADAM. It is essentially local graph databases
that form semantic meaning between [Expressions](/essentials/expressions).

Perspectives only consist of a collection of “links,” which connect
three things: a subject, a predicate, and a target. All three things are URLs pointing to
Expression data in different Languages.

Links inside Perspectives have a signature and show
which agent the link came from. Expressions show the same data to everyone who looks at them,
but Perspectives show how one user connects different Expressions in their own way.

[Perspective class definition](/jsdoc/classes/Agent)

## Create a Perspective and add content

Adding a new perspective is as easy as

```js
const myPerspective = await ad4m.perspective.add("My new perspective");
```

The returned object is of type [PerspectiveProxy](api.md#class-perspectiveproxy),
which hides all the remote calls to the AD4M executor and can be treated like a
local database object.

Perspectives are basically local graph databases.
We can query all links on that proxy object with `get`:

```js
const allLinks = await myPerspective.get(new LinkQuery({})); // => []
```

In this case it should return an empty array since we just created that perspective.

So let's add something!

```ts
const perspective = ad4m.perspective.add("My first perspective");

const link = {
  subject: await ad4m.agent.me(),
  predicate: "sioc://likes",
  target: await ad4m.expression.create("ad4m", "literal"),
};

perspective.add(link);
```

Links consist of 3 URLs pointing to Expressions of Languages.
For this example, we made life easy by using the agent's DID and AD4M's `Literal` Language.

### LinkExpression

We have put in a [Link](api.md#class-link) object into `myPerspective.add()`
(`{source, predicate, target}`),
but what this function returns is a [LinkExpression](api.md#class-linkexpression).

Even though this Perspective is not shared (yet) but just our private, local
graph database, we might want to share it [later](#2-publish-perspective-as-neighbourhood)
as Neighbourhood.
Then, all links added by some agent to their local Perspective will be shared
with the other agents using a LinkLanguage - a Language which defines Expressions
representing Links. That is LinkExpressions.

Using the [generic Expression template](api.html#expressiongeneric),
LinkExpressions wrap Links with author, timestamp and signature:

```js
{
    author: "did:key:zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
    timestamp: "Sun Oct 23 2022 15:31:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)",
    data: {
        source: "did:key:zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
        predicate: "literal://string:thinks",
        target: "literal://string:AD4M%20will%20be%20the%20last%20social%20network",
    },
    proof: {
        key: "#zQ3shNWd4bg67ktTVg9EMnnrsRjhkH6cRNCjRRxfTaTqBniAf",
        signature: "xxxx",
    }
}
```
